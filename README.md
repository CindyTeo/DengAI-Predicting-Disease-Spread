# DengAI-Predicting-Disease-Spread
This is a project hosted by DrivenData to predict weekly number of dengue fever cases in San Juan and Iquitos. 
The datas were analyzed using Poisson and Negative Binomial Regression models by R programming language.
The performance of prediction is measured by Mean Absolute Value (MAE). 
The result is then submitted to DrivenData, with MAE of 25,0601 placing us in rank 1072 out of 12237 participants at the time this is written.

Team members: Bernath Jean Pranata, Cindy, and Danielle Louise.
